2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Giving the user more customizability. i.e. the user can choose the number of buttons, number of rounds, number of mistakes, how fast the buttons light up for, how much faster the rounds become. Or, instead of giving this customizability to the user, I could implement multiple rounds that get harder as the user succeeds, or gets easier as they fail (i.e. if the user successfully completes 8 rounds, the next game will have 10 rounds that are a little faster).
